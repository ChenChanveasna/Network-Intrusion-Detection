# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Network-Intrusion-Detection ML using TII-SSRC-23 and CICIDs2017

Trained two deep learning models to classify network traffic.
If you want to see the full process of project building checkout the Jupyter Notebook in the Repo.
You can find the dataset both datasets in kaggle:
-TII-SSRC-23: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daniaherzalla/tii-ssrc-23
-CICIDs 2017: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset

To test the models you have to run the app.py using streamlit. run this command "streamlit run app.py"
Make sure to have a CSV file format that contain the traffic. If you have pcap you can also extract it using CICFlowMeter.
Also make sure to download the model (.h5) files.

If you are not sure on how to test the application you can also refer to this YouTube video at that specific timestamp: https://youtu.be/pYbZQZcDzMM?si=7Y7It5dl9Zv46Z7w&t=667
If you also don't know how to use CICFlowMeter you can also refer to this YouTube video as well: https://youtu.be/mnvJCo57VZI

Thank you for testing my project. Any comment and feedback for improvement is always welcomed.
